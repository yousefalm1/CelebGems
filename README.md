# Design

The design of this project incorporates a minimalist color scheme, primarily using shades of gray and white. This choice was made to enhance readability, maintain simplicity, and provide a clean aesthetic. The combination of these neutral tones creates a sleek and modern interface, ensuring a pleasant user experience.

Key elements such as buttons on cards feature contrasting orange text, adding a vibrant touch that draws attention to interactive elements. This color contrast not only enhances visual interest but also facilitates intuitive navigation and calls to action within the application. By emphasizing certain elements with color, the design achieves a harmonious balance between functionality and visual appeal. This approach underscores the project's commitment to user-centric design principles.

- Below the two columns, users encounter the Stripe payment box, where they input their card details for payment. Upon completion, they click the "Complete Order" button.
- Upon clicking the "Complete Order" button, users are shown an orange overlay indicating that the payment is being processed.
- After the order is successfully processed, users are redirected to the successful checkout page, which confirms the order and displays the delivery address provided by the user.

### checkout (Logged in user)

- For users who have previously saved a delivery address during checkout by selecting the "Save Delivery Address" checkbox, their saved address will be automatically displayed when they revisit the checkout page. This feature is designed to streamline the checkout process, providing convenience and saving time for returning users.
- Users have the flexibility to edit their saved delivery address if they wish to update it with a new address. This ensures that users can easily manage their delivery preferences without having to re-enter all the information, enhancing the overall user experience during checkout.

## Agile Methodology

### GitHub Project Management

![GitHub project main](documentation/features/github-all-projects.png)

![All Project boards](documentation/features/all-boards.png)

GitHub project management was employed to efficiently organize and track the progress of our project. Each feature had its dedicated project dashboard to streamline management and collaboration.

![bag Project board](documentation/features/bag-board.png)

#### Project Boards

I utilized project boards with five columns, each serving a distinct purpose:

- To Do: Tasks that are yet to be started are placed here.
  Styling: This column remains empty as tasks are moved to the "Done" column upon completion, indicating styled elements.
- In Progress: Tasks actively being worked on are displayed here. Once completed, they move to either the "Done" column or the "Styling" column for final adjustments.
- Bugs: Any identified bugs are placed in this column for resolution. Once fixed, they are moved to the "Done" column, and the issue is closed.
- Done: Completed tasks reside here, marking the culmination of work on each item.

#### Issue Labels

Each issue is labeled to provide clarity and categorization:

- Backend: Indicates an issue related to backend development.
- Frontend: Indicates an issue related to frontend development.
- Bug: Marks an issue as a bug that needs to be addressed.
- Must-Do: Identifies critical issues that must be completed promptly

This is what a project board looks like at the end of the project everything in the done column.

## Information Architecture

- The beginning i created the ERD
- Then used SQLIte to create the database in the early stages of the project
- Then the database was migrated to PostgreSQL towards the end of the project

## Solved Bugs

1.  - Issue: Deployment with DEBUG=False resulted in a server error (HTTP 500) due to static files not being collected.
      Description: The Django project encountered a server error upon deployment with DEBUG=False, indicating that static files were not being properly collected and served. This issue prevented the website from functioning correctly in a production environment.
    - Solution: Adjusted the order of installed apps in the Django settings file to resolve static files collection during deployment.

    - Impact: Resolving the static files collection issue enabled successful deployment of the Django project with DEBUG=False.
      By addressing this issue, static files are now correctly served in the production environment, ensuring smooth website functionality and proper handling of static assets.

2.  - Issue: env.py was being tracked by Git and appeared in the GitHub repository, potentially exposing sensitive information.
      Description: The presence of env.py in the GitHub repository posed a security risk by exposing sensitive environment configuration variables, such as API keys and database credentials.
    - Solution: The bug was resolved by executing the following command in the terminal: `git rm --cached env.py`
    - This command removes env.py from Git's tracking without deleting the file from the local file system. It ensures that env.py is no longer included in future commits and is excluded from the repository.
    - Impact: By addressing this issue, sensitive information contained in env.py is now protected from exposure in the GitHub repository, enhancing the security of the website and ensuring best practices for managing environment configurations.

3.  - Issue: The image fields in both the product model and celebrity profile model were not linked to Cloudinary. Therefore, when the DEBUG setting was set to False and the project was deployed, user-uploaded images did not appear because they were not stored on Cloudinary.
    - Solution: In order to fix this i had to add at the top of the file

          from cloudinary.models import CloudinaryField

      and then replace the image old image field to this

            image = CloudinaryField('image', default='placeholder')

    - Impact: By fixing this bug and linking the image fields to Cloudinary, user-uploaded images began to appear correctly on the deployed project, replacing the placeholder text.

4.  - Issue: The carousel images were not loading from the media files when the project was deployed.
    - Solution: To address this issue, I attempted to resolve it by configuring static and media files properly. However, due to time constraints and the unsuccessful attempt, I opted to upload the images to Cloudinary. I then used the URLs provided by Cloudinary to load the images into the carousel.
    - Impact: This solution allowed me to deploy the finished project successfully with DEBUG mode turned off. However, there is a noticeable impact on image loading time because the images are fetched dynamically from Cloudinary. While this approach is not the most efficient, it was necessary to ensure the deployment of the project within the given time constraints.

5.  - Issue: The env.py file, containing sensitive information like the secret key, was inadvertently pushed to the repository, posing a security risk. Recognizing this error during a session with my mentor.
    - Solution: I took immediate action. I updated the secret key to mitigate any potential exposure from past commits and documented this incident in the README to emphasize the importance of safeguarding sensitive data. This proactive approach ensures the security and integrity of our project moving forward.

## Unsolved Bugs

1.  - Issue: When an admin adds a product to the database via the admin panel and assigns it to a user (celebrity), the product is not automatically linked to the celebrity's profile. Consequently, the admin needs to navigate to the celebrity's profile separately to associate the added product, which adds unnecessary complexity and potential for oversight.

    - On the other hand, when a logged-in celebrity adds a product directly to their profile, it seamlessly appears within their profile without the need for manual linking, ensuring a smoother and more efficient product management experience for celebrities on the platform.

2.  - Issue: Editing profiles displayed on the home screen from the admin panel requires a multi-step process.Description: When an administrator attempts to edit a profile that is currently selected to be displayed on the home screen, there is an inconvenience in the workflow. To make changes to the content of a displayed profile, the administrator must first deselect the "display on home" option, save the changes, then proceed to edit the profile content, re-enable the "display on home" option, and save again.Steps to Reproduce:
3.  Access the admin panel.
4.  Identify the profile displayed on the home screen that requires editing.
5.  Attempt to edit the profile directly.
6.  Encounter the need to first deselect and reselect the "display on home" option.
7.  Make the required changes to the profile content.
8.  Re-enable the "display on home" option.
9.  Save the changes.
